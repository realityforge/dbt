<p>
    Dbt is a ruby library that helps you to automate the <a href="#database-creation">creation</a>,
    <a href="#database-import">importing</a> and <a href="#database-migration">migration</a> of databases.
    Dbt uses convention over configuration and is designed to be a composable component of a larger automation
    tool chain. Dbt has existing drivers for SQL Server and Postgres.
</p>

<h4>Create, Import, Migrate</h4>
<p>
    Dbt expects you to define the database using SQL scripts or via a tool that generates SQL scripts (i.e.
    Domgen). Dbt is responsible for executing the scripts in a defined order. Dbt can also load fixture data
    from yaml files as part of the database creation. Dbt also defines a mechanism for importing one version of
    the database into a newer version. Sometimes modifying an existing database, in easier to manage and Dbt
    offers migrations for use in this scenario.
</p>

<h4>Convention over Configuration</h4>
<p>
    The library adopts a series of conventions aimed to simplify large, complex, legacy projects but without adding
    burden to smaller, early stage projects. In particular it grew out of several complex projects that made extensive
    use of schemas, functions, constraints, stored-procedures, triggers, views and custom types. Most of these projects
    had in excess 5000 database artifacts. The library is also used in projects where the database is little more than
    a persistence mechanism with all the complex business logic outside the database.
</p>

<h4>Composable Component</h4>
<p>
    The library is just one part of the automation tool chain and is easily integrated into other tools. It is used
    extensively with tools such as <a href="">Rake</a>,
    <a href="http://buildr.apache.org">Buildr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/realityforge/domgen">Domgen</a>.

    Getting Started
</h2>

<p>
    A simple database configuration that explicitly defined the schema and the set of tables part of the schema follows;
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
Dbt::Config.config_filename = 'config/database.yml'

Dbt.add_database(:default) do |db|
  db.search_dirs = ["database"]
  db.modules = ['MyModule']
  db.table_map = {'MyModule' => ['MyModule.tblFoo']}
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
    If this was declared within a <code>Rakefile</code>, it would then define the tasks <code>dbt:create</code> and
    <code>dbt:drop</code> that would create and drop the database respectively. The create task would create the
    schema <code>MyModule</code>, scan the <code>search_dirs</code> based on a rules and load any sql files found.
    The task would also fixture data for the <code>MyModule.tblFoo</code> table if a yaml file was found in the correct
    location. The drop task would just delete the database. The runtime configuration required to connect to the
    database is read from the file <code>config/database.yml</code>.
</p>
<p>
    The above example gives a basic feel of the library but it is not representative of how the library is used in
    practice. In most cases, Dbt is integrated into external tools such as Domgen and will not have to define the
    <code>modules</code> or <code>table_map</code>. Nor does the example define any imports, migrations or datasets.
</p>

<p>
    A more realistic example is given below. It configures a single database, and integrates with domgen to define
    the modules, tables and expects domgen to generate sql into <code>database/generated</code> directory.
</p>
{% highlight ruby %}
Dbt::Config.config_filename = 'config/database.yml'
# Explicitly configure the database driver
Dbt::Config.driver = 'sql_server'

Dbt.add_database(:default,
                 :imports =>
                    {
                      # Standard import config
                      :default => {:modules => [:Audit, :Core, :Coordination, :Payroll]},
                      # Customized import for a particular client
                      :client2 => {:modules => [:Audit, :Core], :dir => "client2-imports"},
                      # Customized import with alternative hook actions
                      :client3 => {:modules => [:Audit, :Core],
                                  :post_import_dirs => %w(client3-import-hooks/post),
                                  :dir => "client3-imports"},
                    },
                 # define two datasets that can be loaded into database
                 :datasets => [:sample, :minimal],
                 :migrations => true, # Enable migrations
                 :backup => true,
                 :restore => true) do |database|
  database.search_dirs = ["database/generated", "database"]
  # Integrate with domgen
  database.enable_domgen(:MyApplication, 'domgen:load', 'domgen:sql')
  # Import configurations
  database.import_assert_filters = true
  database.import_task_as_part_of_create = true
  database.separate_import_task = false
end
{% endhighlight %}

    Semantic Model
</h2>

<p>
    Conceptually, each Dbt database is composed of 0 or more modules. Each module maps to a schema in the database
    and by convention the schema is the same name as the module. Each database has a search path form which Dbt
    collects files used to create the database. Each module is mapped to a sub-directory of each element of the
    search path.
</p>

<p>
    Thus if a database definition defined a search path of <code>["database", "database/generated"]</code>, then
    the module "MyModule" would load data from the directories <code>"database/MyModule"</code> and
    <code>"database/generated/MyModule"</code>
</p>

<p>
    Each module has a number of sub directories that contain database entities such as triggers, views,
    stored-procedures etc. A module may also contain a sub-directory that contains fixtures. Fixtures define the
    contents of specific tables at creation time. The module may also include 0 or more directories defining
    import scripts or migration scripts.
</p>

<p>
    The order in which the sub-directories are processed is dependent on the configuration in the database
    definition but follows a specific convention based on the activity. Within a directory, the order of the sql
    files is determined by an index file (named <code>index.txt</code> by default) that lists one sql file per
    line. If the index file is not present or does not include all the sql files, then the sql files are loaded
    in alphanumeric ordering.
</p>

<h3>
    <a name="database-creation" class="anchor" href="#database-creation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
    Database Creation Workflow
</h3>

<h5>Create the database.</h5>

<p>
    During this step the database is created. Both of the existing database drivers will use a control database
    (<code>master</code> for SQL Server and <code>postgres</code> for PostgreSQL) to create the new database. The
    driver will then change to the created database for the remainder of the database creation steps. In some
    environments, it is not possible to access the control database so Dbt allows you to disable database creation
    by setting the <code>no_create</code> flag to false in the runtime configuration file (i.e.
    <code>database.yml</code>). In this scenario it is expected that a system administrator has already set up the
    database.
</p>

<h5>Process the <code>pre_create_dirs</code>.</h5>

<p>
    Load any sql files that need to be loaded prior to processing any modules. The <code>pre_create_dirs</code>
    setting defaults to <code>["db-hooks/pre"]</code>.
</p>

<h5>Process the <em>up</em> phase for each module in order.</h5>

<p>
    The purpose of the up phase is to setup the database but without enabling or creating any runtime checks.
    i.e The tables should be created as part of this phase and populated with any initial fixture data but
    may not yet have constraints or triggers created or if created, left disabled.
</p>

<h6>Create the database schema for the module.</h6>

<p>
    Unless overridden the schema name is the same as the module name. Dbt will create the schema if it
    does not already exist. This allows multiple modules to map to the same database schema or for a module
    to map to a predefined schema. (i.e. <code>dbo</code> under SQL Server or <code>public</code> in postgres).
</p>

<h6>Process the <code>up_dirs</code> for the module.</h6>

<p>
    The <code>up_dirs</code> are used to define the artifacts in the database. They are separated into
    separate directories purely as a mechanism to simplify the ordering of database creation scripts.
    The <code>up_dirs</code> setting defaults to
    <code>['.', 'types', 'views', 'functions', 'stored-procedures', 'misc']</code>.
</p>

<h6>Load any fixtures tables in the module.</h6>

<p>
    The database definition includes a list of tables in each module. Dbt will look for a yaml file
    in the <code>fixture_dir_name</code> that matches the name of the table. This will then be as a
    yaml file and inserted into the database. To ensure the order of the rows, the top level element
    of the yaml file can be encoded as an omap. The <code>fixture_dir_name</code> setting defaults to
    <code>'fixtures'</code>.
</p>

<h5>Process the <em>import</em> phase for each module.</h5>

<p>
    If the creation is a "create_by_import" create, then the import of the module occurs at this step.
    See the <a href="#database-import">import</a> section for further details on importing.
</p>

<h5>Process the <em>finalize</em> phase for each module.</h5>

<p>
    The finalize phase prepares the database for operation. This typically involves enabling triggers,
    rebuilding indexes and applying any final security grants.
</p>

<h6>Process the <code>finalize_dirs</code> for the module.</h6>

<p>
    The finalize dirs are configurable by the <code>finalize_dirs</code> setting which
    defaults to <code>['triggers', 'finalize']</code>.
</p>

<h5>Process the <code>post_create_dirs</code> for the database.</h5>

<p>
    Process the dirs defined by the <code>post_create_dirs</code> setting. The setting defaults to
    <code>["db-hooks/post"]</code>.
</p>

<h5>Setup migrations infrastructure.</h5>

<p>
    The last thing that occurs when creating the database is to setup migrations if migrations are enabled.
    The <a href="#database-migration">migrations</a> section goes into further details about how migrations
    proceeds. During database creation the table that records the migrations is created. By default the
    creation will assume that there is no need to apply the database migrations and will mark all migrations
    present as having being applied. This can be overriden by setting the <code>migrations_applied_at_create</code>
    setting on the database definition in which case the migrations will be applied during database creation.
</p>

<h2>
    <a name="database-import" class="anchor" href="#database-import"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
    Import a Database
</h2>

<p>
    Importing is typically used to upgrade from the old version of the database to the new version of the
    database. Conceptually it selects data form the old database and inserts it into the new database.
    However, like the other components of Dbt it can be overriden by the user. It is not uncommon to use
    the import facility to import from several databases.
</p>

<p>
    The import process can be integrated into the database creation process and/or it can be a
    standalone task. Import that is integrated into the database creation process is much easier to
    manage, primarily as it occurs prior to the database <em>finalize</em> phase and thus triggers
    and constraints are not yet enabled. The standalone import process must also assume that the
    database has already been used and thus must delete data from the tables as part of the import
    process.
</p>

<p>
    It should be noted that the import process will only import data for "importable" tables.
    These constitute any table which does not have a fixture in the fixtures directory.
</p>

<h5>Process the <code>pre_import_dirs</code>.</h5>

<p>
    The pre_import_dirs dirs are configurable by the <code>pre_import_dirs</code> setting which
    defaults to <code>['import-hooks/pre']</code>.
</p>

<h5>Process the <em>delete</em> phase for each module in reverse order.</h5>

<p>
    If the import process is a standalone then the import process will delete data
    from all the importable tables. The delete will delete data from importable tables in
    the reverse order. Each module will also be processed in reverse order.
</p>

<h5>Process the <em>import</em> phase for each module.</h5>
<p>
    Each module will be processed according to the order in which it is declared.
</p>

<h6>Import each table.</h6>

<p>
    Each importable table will be imported in order. Import files are loaded from a directory
    defined in the import definition that defaults to <code>import</code>. If a <code>.yml</code>
    file with the same name as the table is present it is loaded into the table. If a <code>.sql</code>
    file with the same name as the table is present it is processed to import the table. If neither
    a <code>.yml</code> nor a <code>.sql</code> file is present then the import process will attempt
    to import data from the old database using a table name and set of columns that matches the new
    database.
</p>

<h6>Process the <em>post_data_module_import</em> at the end of the import phase for each module.</h6>

<p>
    At the end of importing each module,the database driver is given the option to optimise the
    module using the post_data_module_import hook. The sql server driver will attempt to shrink
    any tables to remove unused space and then re-index the table. Both steps can be disabled
    in the runtime configuration.
</p>

<h5>Process the <code>post_import_dirs</code>.</h5>

<p>
    The <code>pre_import_dirs</code> setting controls the directories processed in this phase and
    it defaults to <code>['import-hooks/pre']</code>.
</p>

<h2>
    <a name="database-migration" class="anchor" href="#database-migration"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
    Migrate a Database
</h2>

<p>
    Migrations are used to incrementally modify a database without recreating or re-importing the database
    from scratch. The <code>migrations_dir_name</code> setting controls the directory from which the migration
    scripts are sourced and defaults to 'migrations'.
</p>

<p>
    The migrations scripts are ordered using the same mechanism as per standard directories using an
    <code>index.txt</code> file or alphanumeric ordering based on the name of the script. When the scripts are
    applied, a record of the application is recorded in a per-database migrations table. The name of the
    migration table differs between databases and is <code>[dbo].[tblMigrations]</code> under sql server and
    <code>"public"."tblMigration"</code> under postgres.
